# WeatherApp

A new Flutter project.

This is a realtime weather app, made with Flutter.

Replace the API_KEY in home.screen.dart with your own API_KEY.

clone the repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/ankurt02/WeatherApp_flutter.git
```

add required dependancies to pubspec.yaml

```

```
